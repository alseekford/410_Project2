## Project 2

Anne Louise Seekford

### Overview

For project two, I applied two regression techniques, **Locally Weighted Linear (LOWESS) and Random Forest**, on the Boston Housing Dataset. The Boston Housing Dataset is derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning homes in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. Although the dataset contains over fifteen columns, each a distinct characteristic of a home in Boston, I will be focusing on only two. The input feature will be 'rooms', describing the average number of rooms per dwelling. The target, which will be predicted, is 'cmedv', the median value of owener-occupied homes (in thousands of dollars).

Descriptions of my process, code, and methods used will be described as follows:

### Locally Weighted Linear Regression (LOWESS)

Stemming from Linear Regression, LOWESS can be considered a non-parametric algorithm that must use all the dataset for estimation (Figueira, 2021).
